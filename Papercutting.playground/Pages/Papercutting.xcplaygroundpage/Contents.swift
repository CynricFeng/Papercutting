 ## What is Papercutting?

 Papercutting is a kind of folk art in China that uses scissors or a knife to cut patterns on paper. When I was a kid, our teachers used papercutting works as rewards. Every time during the Chinese New Year, the Chinese will post window papercutting, which is also a kind of papercutting art, as decorations to accentuate the New Year's atmosphere.
 
 For me, paper-cutting is a unique memory, a memory that children receive praise from the teacher, and a memory of family reunion.
 
 ## Papercutting skills
 
 ### Folding
 
 We can fold the paper and use symmetrical beauty to cut out various patterns.
 
 ### Cutting
 
 There are two ways to cut paper. Yin carving is to engrave the outline lines that represent the structure of objects. Contrary to Yin carving, Yang carving is to cut away the blank part and keep the outline.

 ## Let's start with a circle
 
 Try to fold the paper and cut the paper in two different ways. Finally, you can unfold the paper by pressing the `DONE` button on the touch bar, or pressing the `S` key on the keyboard to see the final work. In the first two levels, you need to cut out a circle and a star, and when pressing `DONE`, you will get a rating for your work. Try to get at least two ðŸŒŸ, or even three. You can click `H` for some tips. When `N` appears, you can click it to go to the next level.
